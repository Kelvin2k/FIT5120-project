- **Bad** (<60% accuracy): Constructive feedback with specific words to practice

#### New Features:
- **Random congratulatory messages** for excellent and good pronunciation
- **Celebration messages** for perfect pronunciation

## Technical Implementation

### Scoring System:
- **95%+ accuracy + no wrong words** → Excellent with celebration
- **85%+ accuracy + no wrong words** → Excellent 
- **75%+ accuracy + ≤1 wrong word** → Good
- **60%+ accuracy** → Neutral (encouragement)
- **<60% accuracy** → Bad (needs practice)

### Visual Feedback:
- **Green colors** for good/excellent pronunciation
- **Animation effects** for excellent results
- **Score display** for successful attempts
- **Celebration elements** for perfect pronunciation

### User Experience:
- **Immediate positive reinforcement** for good pronunciation
- **Motivating messages** to encourage continued practice
- **Clear guidance** on specific words to improve
- **Extended display time** for celebrating success

## Usage
When users speak and achieve good pronunciation (75%+ accuracy), they will see:
1. **Green colored feedback** indicating success
2. **Positive congratulatory messages** 
3. **Score percentage** showing their accuracy
4. **Celebration effects** for excellent pronunciation (95%+)
5. **Encouraging words** to continue practicing

This creates a more positive learning experience that celebrates success while providing constructive guidance for improvement.
